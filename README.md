# WebApp-Dashboard
 Unit 07 Project

Much similar to sites like GitHub, Zillow, and Mint, this project simulates programs that run on your machine. This web application showcase pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These "dashboards" act like your control panel for controlling the web app. 

Emphasis on Javascript-driven charts and graphs.
HTML & CSS included.
